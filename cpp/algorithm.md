hash : This algorithme is based on hashmap associat A -> T, T -> A, C -> G, G -> C.

hash_allocate : same as hash but allocate the return string at the begin of function

hash_switch : same as hash but run the reverse complement in place.

hash_std : same as hash but run the reverse complement in place with gnu lib c++ reverse algorithm

tab : This algorithme is based on char tabluar with 85 (T char value + 1) case and associated A -> T, T -> A, C -> G, G -> C.

tab_allocate : same as tab but allocate the return string at the begin of function

tab_switch : same as tab but run the reverse complement in place.

tab_std : same as tab but run the reverse complement in place with gnu lib c++ reverse algorithm

pol3 : This algoritme is based one a third degree polynomial obtaine by lagrange interpolation.

pol3_allocate : same as pol3 but allocate the return string at the begin of function

pol3_std : same as pol3 but run the reverse complement in place with gnu lib c++ reverse algorithm

pol3_switch : same as pol3 but run the reverse complement in place.

naif : Just some if else

naif_allocate : same as naif but allocate the return string at the begin of function

naif_switch : same as naif but run the reverse complement in place.

naif_std : same as naif but run the reverse complement in place with gnu lib c++ reverse algorithm
