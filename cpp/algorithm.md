hash : This algorithme is based on hashmap associat A -> T, T -> A, C -> G, G -> C.

hash_constref : same as hash but DNA passed with const ref

tab : This algorithme is based on char tabluar with 85 (T char value + 1) case and associated A -> T, T -> A, C -> G, G -> C.

tab_constref : same as tab but DNA passed with const ref

pol3 : This algoritme is based one a third degree polynomial obtaine by lagrange interpolation.

pol3_constref : same as pol3 but DNA passed with const ref

naive : Just some if else

naive_constref : same as naive but DNA passed with const ref
